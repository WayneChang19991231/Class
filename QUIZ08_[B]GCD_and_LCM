The properties of integer values have been studied for centuries in number theory. Two important concepts
developed are the greatest common divisor (GC D ), and least common multiple (LCM). Given two integers
𝑥and 𝑦. The GCD is defined as the largest integer value which can divide both 𝑥and 𝑦, while the LCM is
defined as the smallest integer value which can be divided by both 𝑥and 𝑦. A special properties among 𝑥, 𝑦,
and their GCD, and LCM is 

                                           𝑥𝑦=𝐺𝐶𝐷𝑥,𝑦×𝐿𝐶𝑀𝑥,𝑦.

To determine the values of GCD and LCM, we can first calculate the value of GCD by using the Euclid's
algorithm:

                                           𝐺𝐶𝐷(𝑥,𝑦)=𝐺𝐶𝐷(𝑦, 𝑥 mod 𝑦)
and
                                           𝐺𝐶𝐷(𝑥,0)=𝑥.
                                           
After the value of GCD is determined, the value of LCM can be obtained:

                                           𝐿𝐶𝑀(𝑥,𝑦)= 𝑥𝑦 / 𝐺𝐶𝐷(𝑥,𝑦).
                                           
Write a program to calculate the GCD and LCM. You have to wrap the calculation of GCD and LCM into
two functions.
